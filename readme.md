# Name Animator

This is a simple jQuery project which animates a given name.
To animate your own name, replace 'Enter Your Name' with the name you want to animate.

To change colors, replace the variables named 'red, orange, green, blue and purple' with the color of your own choice. But,
don't forget to replace the names of colors of the 'letterColors' variable with the color you chose.
